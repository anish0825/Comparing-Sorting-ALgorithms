# Comparing-Sorting-ALgorithms

In this project the code is written in Python in IPYNB.
On executing the first cell, the IPYNB will demand the number of input the user wants.
The 2nd cell contains the code for all the sorting algorithms. 
After entering the number of inputs the user has to execute the 2nd cell.
All the codes after that have comments and on executing the codes the user will get the desired results.
